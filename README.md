# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model that classifies customers of a subscription-based service based on their risk of churning—i.e., discontinuing their subscription. By analyzing customer data, the goal is to uncover key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to help businesses improve retention. This model will enable businesses to identify at-risk customers early, allowing for targeted retention strategies that can reduce churn and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Objective
The core objectives of this project are:

- **Predict Customer Churn**: Develop a model that classifies customers as high-risk or low-risk for churn.
- **Identify Key Churn Drivers**: Determine the most important factors (such as customer demographics, usage patterns, and engagement) associated with churn.
- **Provide Actionable Insights**: Offer insights on customer behavior to help businesses create effective retention strategies and proactively address the needs of at-risk customers.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python

### Libraries:
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: Efficient numerical operations
- `matplotlib & seaborn`: Data visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model insights
- `scikit-learn (sklearn)`: Building machine learning models, data preprocessing, and evaluation

## Data Description
The dataset includes customer information from a subscription-based service, with each row representing a customer. The dataset consists of various demographic, service usage, and contract-related attributes that could influence churn:

- **Demographic Attributes**: Gender, SeniorCitizen status, Partner status, Dependents
- **Service Usage Attributes**: Tenure (months of service), PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService type, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, and StreamingMovies
- **Contract & Billing Attributes**: Contract type, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, and TotalCharges
- **Churn Indicator**: The target variable (Yes/No) indicating if the customer has churned

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing ensures data consistency, cleanliness, and readiness for model training. Key steps include:

- **Handling Missing Values**: Clean and convert the `TotalCharges` column, which may contain missing or non-numeric values, to numerical data.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Transform categorical variables (e.g., gender, partner status, payment method) into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize numerical variables (e.g., `MonthlyCharges`, `Tenure`) to ensure they are on a comparable scale.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA uncovers patterns and relationships within the data, laying the groundwork for feature selection and hypothesis generation.

- **Visualize Distributions and Relationships**: Plot the distribution of key variables to see how customer segments differ and how churn varies across demographics and service types.
- **Analyze Correlations**: Identify correlations between features and churn using correlation heatmaps and pair plots.
- **Churn Analysis**: Examine churn behavior within different customer segments (e.g., by contract type, tenure, internet service type) to identify high-risk groups.

### 3. Model Development
Train multiple machine learning models and select the best one for predicting churn.

- **Model Selection**: Train various algorithms, each with unique strengths:
  - Logistic Regression: Baseline model for binary classification and interpretability.
  - Decision Trees & Random Forests: Capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
  - Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM): Often provide superior predictive power with strong control over model complexity.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or random search to fine-tune model parameters for optimal performance.

### 4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's effectiveness and reliability in predicting churn.

- **Metrics**: Assess model performance using relevant classification metrics:
  - Accuracy: Overall proportion of correctly classified cases.
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-score: Especially useful for handling class imbalance.
  - ROC-AUC: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes.
  - Confusion Matrix Analysis: Examine false positives and false negatives to understand the potential costs of misclassification.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the most influential factors on churn using techniques like SHAP values or feature importance plots for tree-based models.

### 5. Results and Insights
Summarize the model’s performance and derive actionable insights based on predictions and feature analysis:

- **Model Performance Summary**: Present an overview of how each model performed on the test set, highlighting the final selected model.
- **Churn Drivers**: Identify key factors influencing churn (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges, internet service type).
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Suggest strategies to improve retention based on the identified factors, such as:
  - **Flexible Contracts**: Incentivize customers with monthly contracts to switch to long-term contracts.
  - **Customer Engagement**: Enhance customer engagement through value-added services like tech support or bundled services to retain high-risk customers.

## Final Deliverables
- **Predictive Model**: A trained and validated model that classifies customers as high-risk or low-risk for churn.
- **Feature Insights**: A report on the key drivers of churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.
- **Retention Recommendations**: Data-driven insights for customer retention strategies that the business can implement.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of data analytics and machine learning in predicting customer behavior. By understanding and predicting churn, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and enhance their overall strategy. The developed model serves as a valuable tool for subscription-based services looking to improve customer retention and satisfaction.
