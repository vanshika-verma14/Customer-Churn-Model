Customer Churn Prediction Project
Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service. By analyzing customer data, including usage metrics, service plans, and customer demographics, the model identifies high-risk customers who are likely to discontinue their subscription. Early identification of such customers enables businesses to implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately reducing churn and improving customer satisfaction.
Objective

The core objectives of this project are:

    Predict Customer Churn: Develop a machine learning model to classify customers as high-risk or low-risk for churn.
    Identify Key Churn Drivers: Determine key factors influencing churn, such as customer behavior and service usage patterns.
    Provide Actionable Insights: Offer insights to help businesses develop targeted strategies for customer retention.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries:
        pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
        numpy: Efficient numerical operations
        matplotlib & seaborn: Data visualization for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model insights
        scikit-learn: Machine learning models, data preprocessing, and evaluation
        joblib: Model saving for deployment

Data Description

The dataset consists of customer information for a subscription-based service. Each row represents a customer, and includes demographic, service usage, and billing attributes, along with the target variable that indicates whether the customer has churned.
Key Attributes:

    Demographic: Gender, SeniorCitizen status, Partner status, Dependents
    Service Usage: Tenure, PhoneService, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, DeviceProtection, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, etc.
    Contract & Billing: Contract type, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
    Target Variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Approach
1. Data Preprocessing

The data is preprocessed to ensure it is clean and ready for model training:

    Handling missing values, especially in the TotalCharges column.
    Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
    Scaling numerical features (e.g., MonthlyCharges, Tenure) for consistency.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is used to uncover patterns and relationships within the data:

    Distribution and relationships between features are visualized to understand churn behavior across demographics and service usage.
    Correlation heatmaps and pair plots help identify strong relationships between features and churn.

3. Model Development

A variety of machine learning algorithms are trained to predict churn:

    Random Forest Classifier is used for its robustness in handling non-linear relationships.
    The model is evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure its ability to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.

4. Model Evaluation

Model performance is assessed using:

    Classification Report: Precision, recall, F1-score for both classes (churned and non-churned).
    Confusion Matrix: Analyzes true positives, false positives, and misclassifications.
    ROC Curve and AUC: Evaluates the model's ability to separate churn and non-churn customers.

5. Results and Insights

The final model provides actionable insights:

    Churn Drivers: Features such as contract type, service tenure, and monthly charges are key indicators of churn.
    Recommendations: Businesses can implement strategies like offering long-term contracts or improving customer engagement to reduce churn.

Final Deliverables

    Predictive Model: A trained Random Forest model capable of predicting customer churn.
    Insights Report: A summary of the key drivers of churn and retention strategies.
    Retention Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions for businesses to improve customer retention.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in solving real-world business problems like customer churn prediction. The model and insights provide actionable strategies to help businesses retain customers and enhance satisfaction, making this a valuable tool for subscription-based services.
